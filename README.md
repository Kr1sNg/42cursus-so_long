# so long - and thanks to all the fish
A 42's project to create a small 2D game with minilibx


## Requirement

Objective of this project is to improve skills in the following areas: window management, event handling, colors, textures, etc

By using the [MiniLibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) graphical library, we can open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events.
